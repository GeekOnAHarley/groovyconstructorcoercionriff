# Groovy Constructors using Lists!? A beautiful, idiomatic Groovy riff

A beautiful little Groovy riff this one, and one that recently caught out some great, old-skool groovy-istas recently[1]. It's even one that's made the equally wonderful @groovypuzzlers account on twitter, so I wanted to use it as the first code riff for the "Geek on a Harley" series.

In this jam we're going to look at a little langauge feature of calling Groovy object constructors with coercion. Don't worry if none of that previous sentence made any sense at all, all will be made clear through the code in this riff.

## Before You Play

Before you get going, this riff requires a few things to be present before you can make music:

* The only initial dependency is on using the Spring Boot CLI. I used the instructions for [installation using the GVM](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli) but you can pick from the options to suit you.
* Download and unzip the riff code using the "Download Zip" button, or if you're happy with using the GIT version control tool then you could use that to clone the repository. If you're feeling really confident you could even [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/](submit a pull request using GitHub), and for that extra effort you'll get some feedback from me as well.

That's about it for the warmup... A working internet connection will be handy for when Spring Boot CLI does its thing.

## How to Play

The riffs, when finished, use the Koan Test Driven Learning approach. The main thing here is that the code is broken into small steps, Koans, expressed by a sequence of breaking tests that represent a learning journey where you will contemplate and fix each of the tests to progress. To run the journey from the command-line all you need to execute, once you've grabbed the
