# Groovy Constructors using Lists!? A beautiful, idiomatic Groovy riff

A beautiful little Groovy riff this one, and one that recently caught out some great, old-skool groovy-istas recently[1]. It's even one that's made the equally wonderful @groovypuzzlers account on twitter, so I wanted to use it as the first code riff for the "Geek on a Harley" series.

In this jam we're going to look at a little langauge feature of calling Groovy object constructors with coercion. Don't worry if none of that previous sentence made any sense at all, all will be made clear through the code in this riff.

## Before You Play

Before you get going, this riff requires a few things to be present before you can make music:

* The only initial dependency is on using the Spring Boot CLI. I used the instructions for [installation using the GVM](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-installing-the-cli) but you can pick from the options to suit you.
* That's about it... A working internet connection will be handy for when Spring Boot CLI does its thing.
